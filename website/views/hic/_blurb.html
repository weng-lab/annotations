<h4 style="margin-top: 0px;">Hi-C regions</h4>
Hi-C experiments, first invented by Job Dekker, produce a 3D map of genomic architecture by quantifying interactions between DNA loci genome-wide. As part of the ENCODE project, Job Dekker’s lab performed Hi-C experiments on 12 human cell lines and provided the raw FASTQ data and computed the contact maps using these data.  Topologically associated domains (TADs) are sub-megabase interactions domains that tend to be conserved across cell types and species (Dixon, Jesse R et al. "Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions." Nature 485 (2012): 376-380). Genomic compartments describe a higher level of chromatin organization, whereby frequent interactions are observed among gene-rich regions in compartment A and among gene-poor regions in compartment B but the interactions across compartments A and B are much less frequent.  Using methods developed by the Dekker lab (Lajoie, Bryan R, Job Dekker, and Noam Kaplan. "The Hitchhiker’s guide to Hi-C analysis: practical guidelines." Methods 72 (2015): 65-75), we provide tracks for TADs and compartments in all 12 cell types.
