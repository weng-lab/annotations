<h4 style="margin-top: 0px;">Candidate enhancers based on DNase and H3K27ac signals</h4>
<p>DNase hypersensitivity and histone modification H3K27ac are well-known indicators of enhancer function. We have developed an unsupervised method that combines DNase and H3K27ac signals in the same cell type to predict enhancers. When tested on mouse transgenic assays, our method shows higher accuracy than DNase and H3K27ac individually. We have applied this method to {{stats.human_both}} human cell types and {{stats.mouse_both}} mouse cell types with both DNase and H3K27ac data generated by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomic consortia. You can query these enhancers by genomic locations, nearby genes, or SNPs, and visualize them in the UCSC and WashU genome browsers.
