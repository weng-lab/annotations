  <p>Some of the regions identified by our method are located near transcription start sites (TSS) of genes, and these regions may be active promoters. We indicate regions within 2kb of a GENCODE TSS using a lighter shade of green. Furthermore, if the TSS is within 50 bp of the DNase peak center, the thicker box indicating the DNase peak is in red.
