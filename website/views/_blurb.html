<p>DNase hypersensitivity and histone modification H3K27ac are well-known indicators of enhancer function. We have developed an unsupervised method that combines DNase and H3K27ac signals in the same cell type to predict enhancers. When tested on mouse transgenic assays, our method shows higher accuracy than DNase and H3K27ac individually. We have applied this method to 52 human cell types and 20 mouse cell types with both DNase and H3K27ac data generated by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomic consortia. You can query these enhancers by genomic locations, nearby genes, or SNPs, and visualize them in the UCSC genome browser.

<p>For additional 265 human cell types and 135 mouse cell types, there is only DNase or H3K27ac data available, but not both. We have predicted candidate enhancers based on DNase or H3K27ac signal alone. For the regions predicted using DNase signal, we indicate regions that have consistently low H3K27ac signal in all available H3K27ac datasets with a lighter shade of green, because these regions may correspond to other types of regulatory regions, e.g., insulators or repressors. For comparison purpose, we also predict candidate enhancers based on DNase or H3K27ac alone for those cell types with both data types.
