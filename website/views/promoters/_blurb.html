<h4 style="margin-top: 0px;">Promoter-like regions based on DNase and H3K4me3 signals</h4>
<p>DNase hypersensitivity and histone modification H3K4me3 are well-known indicators of promoter function. We have developed an unsupervised method that combines DNase and H3K4me3 signals in the same cell type to predict promoter-like regions. When used to predict ranked gene expression from RNA-seq data, our method shows higher accuracy than DNase and H3K4me3 individually. We have applied this method to 107 human cell types and 14 mouse cell types with both DNase and H3K4me3 data generated by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomic consortia. For cell and tissues types with only H3K4me3 data, we centered predictions on H3K4me3 peaks and ranked them by H3K4me3 signals. You can query these promoter-like regions by genomic locations, nearby genes, or SNPs, and visualize them in the UCSC and WashU genome browsers.
