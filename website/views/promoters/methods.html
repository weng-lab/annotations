      <p>DNase hypersensitivity and histone modification H3K27ac are well-known indicators of enhancer function. We have developed an unsupervised method that combines DNase and H3K27ac signals in the same cell type to predict enhancers. When tested on mouse transgenic assays, our method shows higher accuracy than DNase and H3K27ac individually. We have applied this method to {{stats.human_both}} human cell types and {{stats.mouse_both}} mouse cell types with both DNase and H3K27ac data generated by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomic consortia. You can query these enhancers by genomic locations, nearby genes, or SNPs, and visualize them in the UCSC and WashU genome browsers.

      <p>For additional {{stats.human_not_both}} human cell types and {{stats.mouse_not_both}} mouse cell types, there is only DNase or H3K27ac data available, but not both. We have predicted candidate enhancers based on DNase or H3K27ac signal alone. For the regions predicted using DNase signal, we indicate regions that have consistently low H3K27ac signal in all available H3K27ac datasets with a lighter shade of green, because these regions may correspond to other types of regulatory regions, e.g., insulators or repressors. For comparison purpose, we also predict candidate enhancers based on DNase or H3K27ac alone for those cell types with both data types.

      <p>Some of the regions identified by our method are located near transcription start sites (TSS) of genes, and these regions may be active promoters. We indicate regions within 2kb of a GENCODE TSS using a lighter shade of green. Furthermore, if the TSS is within 50 bp of the DNase peak center, the thicker box indicating the DNase peak is in red.
